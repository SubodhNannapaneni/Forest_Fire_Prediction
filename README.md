# Forest_Fire_Prediction
Customers have been categorised as ‘good’ and ‘bad’, based on their NPA_Status (non-performing asset status).
Please follow the below given instructions:
1.	Check the data for outliers and missing values and where found, treat them appropriately.
2.	Prepare the data for model building.
3.	Decide on the appropriate algorithm to segment the good and bad customers correctly so that required strategies can be built on them.
4.	Devise the strategies you think are appropriate for the different segments of customers and share them via a presentation.
